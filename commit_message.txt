Fix navbar duplication issue in dashboard routes and add user-notification navbar

- Added NavbarWrapper component to conditionally render the global navbar
- Fixed MergedNavbar component to properly include notification features
- Updated root layout to use NavbarWrapper instead of direct Navbar inclusion
- Created MergedNavbar for user-notification route with enhanced notification features
- Updated user-notification page to use its own MergedNavbar component
- Ensured dashboard routes only show one navbar (MergedNavbar)
- Fixed avatar fallback rendering in user profile dropdown
- Added notification-specific navigation and enhanced notification dropdown

This change prevents duplicate navbars from appearing on dashboard routes while
maintaining the global navbar on non-dashboard routes. The user-notification
route now has its own specialized navbar with integrated notification features.
