refactor: restructure app with Next.js route groups and merge navigation components

1. Implemented Next.js Route Groups:
   - Created (main) route group for public pages with global Navbar
   - Created (dashboard) route group for dashboard pages with custom navigation
   - Moved (navbar) folder into (main) folder
   - Moved dashboard folder into (dashboard) folder

2. Created a merged navigation component (MergedNavbar):
   - Combined global Navbar and dashboard Header into a single component
   - Preserved all routes and functionality from both components
   - Integrated notification system with user profile controls
   - Maintained consistent styling and user experience

3. Updated layouts:
   - Root layout now provides only basic structure and UserProvider
   - (main) layout includes the global Navbar for public pages
   - (dashboard) layout provides context providers for dashboard features
   - Dashboard-specific layout uses the new MergedNavbar component

4. Fixed context provider issues:
   - Properly nested NotificationProvider and HomeNotificationProvider
   - Removed redundant providers from individual pages
   - Fixed empty reducer function in HomeNotificationContext
