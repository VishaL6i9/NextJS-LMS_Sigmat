Fix navbar duplication issue in dashboard routes

- Added NavbarWrapper component to conditionally render the global navbar
- Fixed MergedNavbar component to properly include notification features
- Updated root layout to use NavbarWrapper instead of direct Navbar inclusion
- Ensured dashboard routes only show one navbar (MergedNavbar)
- Fixed avatar fallback rendering in user profile dropdown

This change prevents duplicate navbars from appearing on dashboard routes while
maintaining the global navbar on non-dashboard routes.
